# General description: Dynamic-saltmarsh-microphytobenthos-model
The model is described in Brückner et al. (2019) https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JF005092 and Brückner et al. (2020) https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026945 and computes dynamic interactions between saltmarsh vegetation or microphytobenthos (MATLAB) and hydro-morphodynamic computations in Delft3D. The species computations can be found in the folder 'Matlab vegetation modules'. 'Matlab functions' contain additional functions called by the code. The model has been tested with MATLAB 2017a. For detailed description of the model, please refer to the Modeldescription.pdf. A test domain will be uploaded soon.

# Files
The GVeg.txt and MVeg.txt-files are example files of the vegetation read by the MATLAB code. Phyto1.txt contains the parameters for the microphytobenthos computations.
