# Dynamic-saltmarsh-microphytobenthos-model
The model is described in Brückner et al. (2019) https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JF005092 and Brückner et al. (2020) https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026945 and computes dynamic interactions between saltmarsh vegetation or microphytobenthos (MATLAB) and hydro-morphodynamic computations in Delft3D. The model has been run on MATLAB 2017a. For detailed description of the model, please refer to the Modeldescription.pdf.
